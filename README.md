Always know how your significant other is feeling!

In every strong relationship, there are still issues that no one wants to talk about. Part of the problem is that partners are unaware of passive aggressive behavior exhibited by their spouses and this can lead to domestic abuse. Our android app helps to combat the inner tensions within relationships by allowing couples to share with each other their current emotions and mood so that the couple can engage in an appropriate tone for the conversation. In addition, if a user selects a negative mood too many times in succession, our app displays, in bar charts, the number of times the user selected each mood and offers tips for relationship advice and how to interact with others.
